\title{Read and Process DARDAR Data from a NetCDF File}
\usage{
read_dardar(fn_dardar)
}
\arguments{
\item{fn_dardar}{A character string specifying the file path to the DARDAR NetCDF file.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the DARDAR data with columns for latitude (\code{lat}), longitude (\code{lon}), height (\code{height}),
time (\code{time}), and their corresponding indices (\code{idx_height}, \code{idx_time}).
}
\description{
This function reads DARDAR data from a NetCDF file and extracts variables such as latitude, longitude, height, and time.
The data is returned as a data frame with indexed height and time levels.
}
\details{
The function reads specific variables like latitude, longitude, height, and time from the DARDAR NetCDF file using \code{ncdf4::ncvar_get}.
Time is adjusted using a base time value to return proper timestamps. The DARDAR data is structured in a data frame with expanded grids
for height and time indices.
