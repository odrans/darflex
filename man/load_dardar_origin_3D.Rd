\title{Load and Process 3D DARDAR Origin Data}
\usage{
load_dardar_origin_3D(fn_dardar_origin, lf_dardar)
}
\arguments{
\item{fn_dardar_origin}{A character string specifying the file path to the DARDAR origin NetCDF file.}

\item{lf_dardar}{A character vector containing the list of available DARDAR files.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the processed DARDAR origin data combined with the DARDAR file, including cloud properties, ice water content (IWC), and temperature at ice formation.
}
\description{
This function loads DARDAR origin and corresponding DARDAR data from NetCDF files, processes key variables such as origin, cloud properties, ice water content (IWC), and temperature. It filters the data based on cloud masks and mixed-phase flags and returns the processed data.
}
\details{
This function matches the DARDAR origin file to the corresponding DARDAR file and reads both to extract key variables. It filters the data for valid cloud layers and non-mixed-phase clouds and combines the data into a single data frame.
